                      I joined Philippe Coussot as a PhD student in October 2019
                      to focus on fluid transfers in wood. My work is
                      co-financed and shared between Navier Laboratory at ENPC
                      and the Experimental Soft Condensed Matter Group at
                      Harvard University. We intend to better understand fluid
                      exchanges (vapor, free water and bound water in the liquid
                      state) between vessels, fibers and cell walls in
                      hardwoods. The challenge is to develop physical models to
                      master mechanisms at work for wood treatments, durability
                      of wooden constructions.

                      I joined Philippe Coussot as a PhD student in October 2019
                      to focus on fluid transfers in wood. My work is
                      co-financed and shared between Navier Laboratory at ENPC
                      and the Experimental Soft Condensed Matter Group at
                      Harvard University. We intend to better understand fluid
                      exchanges (vapor, free water and bound water in the liquid
                      state) between vessels, fibers and cell walls in
                      hardwoods. The challenge is to develop physical models to
                      master mechanisms at work for wood treatments, durability
                      of wooden constructions.
